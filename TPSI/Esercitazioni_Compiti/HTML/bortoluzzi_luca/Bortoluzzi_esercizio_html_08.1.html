    <div ><h4>localhost</h4>
      <img src="https://mythemeshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-localhost.png" width="250" alt="What is a localhost?">
        <p>In <span style="color:green">computer</span> networking, localhost is a <code>hostname</code> that refers to the current computer used to access it.<br> It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.</p>
        </div>
<span><h4>Loopback</h4></span>
<hr>
<p>The local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">loopback</a> mechanism <s>may</s> be used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical<br> network interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL http://localhost to display its home page.
<hr style="height: 5px; background-color: black;">
    The name <bold>localhost</bold> normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the IPv6 loopback address ::1.</p>
<h4>Name resolution</h4>
<p>IPv4 <span style="color:red">network</span> <s>standards</s> reserve the entire <s>address</s> block 127.0.0.0/8 (more than 16 million addresses) for loopback<br> purposes.[2] That means any packet sent to any of those addresses is looped back. The address 127.0.0.1 is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest are not supported by all operating systems. However, they can be used to set up multiple server applications on the host, all listening on the same port number. The IPv6 standard assigns only a single address for loopback: ::1.
The resolution of the name <strong>localhost</strong> to one or more <bold>IP</bold> addresses is normally configured by the following lines in the<br> operating system's hosts file:<br></p>
<h5>127.0.0.1    localhost
::1          localhost
</h5>
<img src="https://github.com/Luca-Bortoluzzi/Bortoluzzi_esercizi_html/blob/main/Bortoluzzi_esercizio_html_04.png?raw=true" width="200" alt="localhost">
<p>The name may also be resolved by <mark>Domain</mark> Name System (DNS) servers, but queries for this name should be resolved locally,<br> and should not be forwarded to remote name servers.

In <mark>addition</mark> <u>to the mapping of localhost</u> to the loopback addresses (127.0.0.1 and ::1), <u>localhost may also be mapped to other</u><br> IPv4 (loopback) addresses and it is also possible to assign other, or additional, names to any loopback address. The mapping of localhost to addresses other than the designated loopback address range in the hosts file or in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as applications may map the name internally.

In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">Domain</a> Name System, the name localhost is reserved as a top-level domain name, <u>originally set aside to avoid confusion with the hostname used for loopback purposes</u>.[3] IETF standards prohibit domain name <u>registrars from assigning the name localhost.</u>>

<h4>IETF standards</h4>
<hr>
<div style="background-color:blue ;color:white">The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes by RFC 6761 (Special-Use Domain Names),[4] which achieved the Proposed Standardmaturity level in February 2013.</div> The standard sets forth a number of special considerations governing the use of the name in the Domain Name System:
<br>
An <bold><abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr></bold> or <bold><abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr></bold> address query for the name localhost must always resolve to the respective loopback address, which is specified in a separate standard.
<strong>Applications</strong> may resolve the name to a <mark>loopback</mark> address themselves, or pass it to the <u>local name</u> resolver mechanisms.<br>
When a name resolver receives an address <small>(A or AAAA)</small> query for localhost, it should return the appropriate loopback addresses, and<br> negative responses for any other requested record types. <small>Queries</small> for localhost should not be sent to caching <i>name servers</i>.
To avoid burdening     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">the</a> Domain Name System root servers with traffic, caching name servers should never request name server records for<br> localhost, or <i>forward</i> resolution to authoritative name servers.
<em><abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr></em> registrars are precluded from delegating domain names in the <q>top-level domain localhost</q>.
When authoritative name servers receive queries for 'localhost' in spite of the provisions mentioned resolve them appropriately.
<div style="background-color:blue ;color:white">The IPv4 loopback addresses are reserved within the IPv4 address space by the IETF "Special Use IPv4 Addresses" standard (RFC 5735).</div><br> The <i>reservation</i> can be traced back to the <small>November</small> <strong>1986</strong> "Assigned Numbers" standard (RFC 990).

In contrast, the <strong>IETF</strong> <i>"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"</i> standard <s>(RFC 4291)</s> reserves the single IPv6 loopback address ::1 within<br> the IPv6 address space. The standard precludes the <small>assignment</small> of that address to any physical interface, as well as its use as the <s>source</s> or destination address in any packet sent to <strong>remote</strong> hosts. Any such packet that is erroneously transmitted is <del>supposed</del> to be routed, and should be dropped by all routers or hosts that receive it.

<h4>Packet processing</h4>
<hr>
The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost"> processing</a> of any packet sent to a loopback address, is implemented in the link layer of the TCP/IP stack. Such packets are never passed<br> to any network interface controller (NIC) or hardware device driver and <q>must not appear outside of a computing system</q>, or be routed by any router. This permits software testing and local services in the absence of any hardware network interfaces.

<span style="color:blue">Looped-back</span> packets are distinguished from any other packets traversing the TCP/IP stack only by the special IP address they were addressed to.<br> Thus, the services that ultimately receive them respond according to the specified destination. 
<pre>    For example, an HTTP service could route
     <q>packets addressed</q>  to   <em>127.0.0.99:80</em> and
       <em>127.0.0.100:80</em> to different     Web servers, or to a single server that returns different web pages. To simplify <del>such</del> testing, 
       the hosts file may be    configured to provide appropriate names
       for each address.
</pre>
<ins>Packets</ins> received on a <bold>non-loopback</bold> interface with a <i>loopback</i> source or destination address must be dropped. Such packets are sometimes referred to<br> as Martian packets.[6] <b>As with any other bogus packets, they may be malicious and any problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon <em>filtering</em></b>.

<h4>Special cases</a></h4>
<hr>
The <del>releases</del> of the <span style="color:green"><cite>MySQL</span> database differentiate <sub>between</sub> the use of the <mark>hostname</mark> <sup>localhost</sup> and the use of the addresses <mark>127.0.0.1</mark> and ::1.<br> When using localhost as the destination in a client connector interface of an application, the <em>MySQL</em>> application programming interface connects to the database using a Unix domain socket, while a TCP connection via the <ins>loopback</ins> interface requires the direct use of the <del>explicit</del> <ins>address</ins>>.

One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">notable</a> exception to the use of the <span style="color:green">127.0.0.08</span> addresses is their use in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traceroute <del>error</del> detection,<br> in which their property of not <del>being</del> <ins>routable</ins> provides a convenient means to avoid delivery of faulty packets to <ins>end users</ins>.
